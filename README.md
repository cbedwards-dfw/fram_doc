# fram_doc
Documentation for [FRAM](https://github.com/FRAMverse/FRAM) Development fork to allow testing of github pages rendering for possible changes.

## Workflow

It appears that the process is 

changes to local .Rmd file -> render locally -> git add the .rmd and html files, commit and push.

After a few minutes for github to rebuild the pages site (you can track this in the "Actions" tab), force-refresh the page(s) you changed (in windows, ctrl-F5).
